* Thinking Recursiv`ely - Sum function as example
From Prof. Hutton's YouTube channel [[https://youtu.be/n6bg8L91Qew][Link]]
** Name the function
- sum
** Write down its type
- sum :: [Int] -> Int
** Enumerate the cases - The skeleton
- sum [] =
- sum (x:xs) =
** Define the simple cases
- sum [] = 0
** List the "ingredients"
What are the options to fill the right side?
** Define the other cases
- sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs
